    <p><strong>READ MORE ABOUT CHIEF OBAFEMI AWOLOWO</strong></p>
  
  <P>Awolowo was born in Ikenne, then part of the British Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The son of a peasant, Awolowo first studied to be a teacher and later worked as a clerk, trader, and newspaper reporter while organizing trade unions and participating in nationalist politics in his spare time. In the 1930s he became an active member of the Lagos Youth Movement—later the Nigerian Youth Movement—and rose to become its secretary for the Western Province. During that time he came to bemoan the ethnic divisions within the nationalist movement and the growing political inequalities between some of Nigeria’s ethnic nationalities and regions.</p>

<p>Awolowo went to London in 1944 to study law, and while there he founded the Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Yoruba: “Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa”) to promote the culture and unity of the Yoruba people, one of the three largest ethnic groups in colonial Nigeria, and to ensure a secure future for them. During that period Awolowo also wrote the influential Path to Nigerian Freedom (1947), in which he made his case for the need of a federal form of government in an independent Nigeria to safeguard the interests of each ethnic nationality and region and to create a sustainable basis for Nigerian unity. He also called for rapid progress toward self-government.</p>


<p>In 1947 Awolowo returned to Ibadan to practice law, and the following year he established the Egbe Omo Oduduwa in Nigeria. In 1950–51 he founded a political party, the Action Group, with some of the Egbe’s members as its nucleus, and in the process became the party’s first president. The party called for an immediate end to British rule and for the development of several social welfare programs.</p>
  
<p>In 1951 the party won the first elections held in the Western Region, one of the colony’s three administrative divisions, and Awolowo later served as leader of government business and minister for local government structure, the latter for which he established elective councils. From 1954 to 1959, as premier of the Western Region, Awolowo worked to improve education, social services, and agricultural practices, implementing many progressive policies. Notably, his administration introduced programs that provided free health care for children and free universal primary education. The first television station in Africa was established in the Western Region by his administration as well.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, he tried to build the Action Group into an effective nationwide party by making alliances with ethnic groups in other regions. Awolowo supported his party’s efforts to accelerate Nigeria’s progress toward self-government by pushing the British to commit to an early date for independence. After a disappointing showing in the hard-fought 1959 elections and after the two other major parties had formed a coalition, he became leader of the opposition in the federal House of Representatives. After Nigeria achieved independence in 1960, Awolowo began to modify his earlier position, leaning toward socialism and advocating a neutral foreign policy rather than his earlier pro-Western position.</p>


<p>With dissension growing in his own party over both ideology and administration, Awolowo fought to maintain ascendancy. Although he managed to prevail at the annual party conference in 1962, one year later he was tried and convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released after a military coup took place in July 1966—the second coup to occur that year.</p>

<p>Later that year Awolowo was a member of the National Conciliation Committee, which attempted to mediate a rift between the federal government and the Eastern Region, which was inhabited predominantly by the Igbo people. Mediation attempts failed, and he eventually threw his support behind the federal government when the region seceded as the Republic of Biafra, sparking civil war (1967–70). During the conflict, Awolowo was federal commissioner for finance and vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council. In the mid-1970s he was chancellor of the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) and Ahmadu Bello University.</p<


<p>When the 12-year ban on political activity was lifted in 1978 in preparation for a return to civilian rule, Awolowo emerged as the leader of the Unity Party of Nigeria. He ran for president in the elections of 1979 and 1983 but was defeated both times by Shehu Shagari. Following a military coup at the end of 1983, parties were once again banned, and Awolowo retired from politics.</p>

<p>An important figure in Nigerian history, Awolowo’s ideals and accomplishments continue to influence Nigerian politics. He wrote several books, including Awo: The Autobiography of Chief Obafemi Awolowo (1960) and Thoughts on Nigerian Constitution (1966).</p>
